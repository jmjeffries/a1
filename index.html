		<h3> A little bit about me </h3>
		<p> I am a senior because I transferred here with credits I got in high school. I started classes during covid so I'm a little bit off schedule, but I'm trying to make that up this year.
			I don't know exactly what I want to do once I graduate, but I do know that I like coding/programming and the accomplishment I feel when finishing a project.</p>
